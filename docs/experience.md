# Feynman Lectures Visualization Project: Learning Experience Design

## Educational Philosophy

The learning experience design for this project is guided by these core principles:

1. **Conceptual Understanding Over Memorization**: Following Feynman's approach of building intuitive understanding rather than rote learning
2. **Interactive Exploration**: Enabling active manipulation of physics concepts through simulation
3. **Multi-Representational Learning**: Presenting concepts through text, visuals, math, and interactive models
4. **Progressive Complexity**: Layering complexity gradually as foundational concepts are mastered
5. **Learning By Doing**: Incorporating challenges that require applying understanding to new situations
