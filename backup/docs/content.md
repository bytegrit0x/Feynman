# Feynman Lectures Visualization Project: Content Architecture

## Content Structure Overview

The content architecture is organized around the three volumes of Feynman's lectures, maintaining their logical progression while enhancing them with interactive elements:

1. **Volume I: Mechanics, Radiation, and Heat**
   - Foundational physics concepts
   - Classical mechanics and Newton's laws
   - Oscillations, waves, and thermodynamics
   - Special relativity

2. **Volume II: Electromagnetism and Matter**
   - Electric and magnetic fields
   - Electromagnetic waves
   - Maxwell's equations
   - Properties of materials

3. **Volume III: Quantum Mechanics**
   - Quantum behavior and wave-particle duality
   - Probability amplitudes
   - Schrödinger equation
   - Atomic physics

## Content Hierarchy

Each volume is structured in a hierarchical manner:

```
Volume
└── Chapter
    └── Section
        └── Concept
            ├── Interactive Simulation
            ├── Text Explanation (from original lectures)
            ├── Annotations and Extensions
            └── Exercises and Challenges
```

## Learning Paths and Progression Models

The platform will offer multiple navigation options:

1. **Linear Path**: Following Feynman's original lecture sequence
2. **Concept-Based Path**: Organized around key physics concepts rather than lecture order
3. **Application-Based Path**: Organized around real-world applications of physics principles
4. **Difficulty-Based Path**: Progressing from simple to more complex concepts regardless of topic

## Content-Simulation Relationships

Each simulation is tightly integrated with lecture content through:

1. **Concept Mapping**: Clear identification of which physics concepts are illustrated
2. **Text Annotation**: Relevant lecture passages linked directly to simulation components
3. **Parameter Alignment**: Variables in simulations directly reflect those discussed in lectures
4. **Original Diagrams**: Feynman's hand-drawn diagrams incorporated and enhanced with interactive elements
