## 6. Cost Reduction Strategies

1. **Phased Implementation**
   - Begin with Volume I only: Reduce initial development to $850,000
   - Add Volumes II and III in subsequent phases

2. **Open Source Community**
   - Develop as open source project with community contributions
   - Potential reduction: $200,000-400,000 in development costs

3. **Educational Partnerships**
   - Partner with universities for development resources
   - Secure educational grants for funding
   - Potential reduction: $300,000-500,000

4. **Infrastructure Optimization**
   - Use academic or educational hosting discounts
   - Implement progressive loading to reduce CDN costs
   - Potential reduction: $50,000-100,000

5. **Revenue Opportunities**
   - Institutional subscriptions for advanced features
   - Corporate sponsorships for public access
   - Educational licensing for specific use cases

## 7. Financial Assumptions

- All costs in USD
- Personnel costs include benefits, taxes, and overhead
- Cloud costs assume gradual user growth to 100,000 active users by end of Year 1
- No physical office space included (remote-first team)
- LLM costs based on current API pricing models (March 2025)
- Contingency of approximately 10% built into personnel and infrastructure costs
